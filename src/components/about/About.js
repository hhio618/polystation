                    Binance Smart Chain is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible Proof-of-Stake network built by Binance. Users can build decentralized applications and digital 
assets on Binance Smart Chain to take advantage of its fast transaction speed and robust security. Applications originally built on Ethereum can easily be migrated to 
Binance Smart Chain, allowing for an inclusive ecosystem with a platitude of use-cases to flourish on. Decentralized finance projects built on Binance Smart Chain can 
enjoy a fast block time of ~5 seconds and make use of the vibrant ecosystem tools built by Binance such as the Panama cross-chain transfer feature and more.

                    <span className="defiOverviewContent">
                    Defistation calculates the 24 hour change in TVL by counting the change in Total Value Locked in the past 24 hours from the time you are visiting the website. 
For example, if you visit Defistation at 3:20 PM, the “Change 24h” will represent the change in TVL between 3:00 PM the day before and 3:00 PM today.

                    All DeFi projects listed on Defistation go through an initial screening process, followed by strict due diligence and communication to confirm the validity of 
information we display. Projects that have a “Verified” badge next to their name are projects that have confirmed that the list of contracts included in 
TVL calculation is up-to-date and accurate.

                    Defistation collects the list of contracts and contract ABIs of each project to monitor their balance on Binance Smart Chain. We pull the total balance of each 
smart contract by aggregating the total amount of BNB and BSC tokens every hour. The total value locked is displayed by taking this amount and multiplying them 
by the current USD value of each token.
